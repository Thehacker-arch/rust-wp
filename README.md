# WalkingPegasus
Written in Rust, a fast and efficient backdoor.

### Added 
```
1.) AddToStartup
2.) Screenshot
3.) Record sound from microphone
4.) Change Wallpaper
5.) Download any file by get request, from url parameter.
6.) Hide the binary after execution.
7.) A few binary optimizations: Crash handling
```
### Todo
```
1. Make use of the webcam
2. Open any url in the webbrowser on victim's pc, perhaps porn xD.
3. Binary optimizations: minimize size (3-8 mb), proper error handling so no crashes happen, anti-debugging (avoid Malware Analysis).
4. Fix the "TimedOut" error in the Download from get requests feature.
```
